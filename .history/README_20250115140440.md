## 🛠️ Instructions to Prepare the Data:

1. Place the ObesityDataSet.csv file in the project directory.

2. Ensure the folder structure matches the requirements specified in the notebook.

## 📋 Description

This project focuses on analyzing obesity-related datasets to classify individuals and explore clustering structures within the data. It involves:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

- Implementation of supervised algorithms (e.g., KNN, SVM) for classification.

- Implementation of unsupervised algorithms (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering) for clustering.

- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and silhouette scores for performance assessment.

## 📂 Files

- ObesityDataSet.csv: Dataset containing features related to obesity.

- main.ipynb: The core notebook containing the entire analysis and implementation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

🛠️ Instructions to Prepare the Data:

Place the ObesityDataSet.csv file in the project directory.

Ensure the folder structure matches the requirements specified in the notebook.

📋 Description

This project focuses on analyzing obesity-related datasets to classify individuals and explore clustering structures within the data. It involves:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Implementation of supervised algorithms (e.g., KNN, SVM) for classification.

Implementation of unsupervised algorithms (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering) for clustering.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and silhouette scores for performance assessment.
